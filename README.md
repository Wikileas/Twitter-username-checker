## About it
This is Twitter username checker, optimized the most by my tiny little knowledge, to load things fast, and do requests faster. Modify with proxies if you want to, but it will for sure consume your proxies rather quickly.

## Notes
There's two versions to this: `twitter.py` suited better for bigger files, loads them quickly and is more precise, while makes requests slower, while `faster_imprecise.py` is much faster, it loads the file first, and is more imprecise, you decide, or just run both with different IPs.

## How to use

Just run the following command: `python3 twitter.py` OR `python twitter.py` and load up usernames you desire to check into the `usernames.txt` file.

## Anaconda

If you are using Anaconda, this being in Windows, using `python3` might not work, try using `python` instead.
