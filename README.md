## About it
This is Twitter username checker, optimized the most by my tiny little knowledge, to load things fast, and do requests faster. Modify with proxies if you want to, but it will for sure consume your proxies rather quickly.

## How to use

Just run the following command: `python3 twitter.py` OR `python twitter.py` and load up usernames you desire to check into the `usernames.txt` file.

## Anaconda

If you are using Anaconda, this being in Windows, using `python3` might not work, try using `python` instead.
